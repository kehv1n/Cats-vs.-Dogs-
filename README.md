# Cats-vs.-Dogs-
### Super Basic Image Classifier 

Can take any image and categorize the animal it see's as either a dog or cat with **97.3% accuracy.** 

Used [University of Oxford's](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/) vgg16 model as a base. With no modifications of the layers, the model can classify accurately **any animal** (ie Golden Retriever, Bengal Cat, Rottweiler). 


The last layer of the learning model was changed to simply return: cat or dog. 

Used the [Dogs v Cats Redux dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) from Kaggle. 

Created to get my feet wet with deep learning (& machine learning).
